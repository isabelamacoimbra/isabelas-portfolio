                        The project background was promoting the FIFA World Cup 2026 in Toronto. I used Canva to design
                        the social media calendar of the posts during June and July 2026, before, during and after the
                        event.

                        I considered holidays and potential days to create a strategy for posting directed to their
                        target audience focusing on increasing their ROI and the awareness of the celebration of the
                        cultural
                        diversity of Toronto and relating it to the World Cup.

                        Lightning. Using Canva, I created a presentation to be shared with the employees with the main
                        policies of the company to protect their reputation, manage risks and prevent future crisis.

                    <h3>Creativity for Students</h3>
                    <p>
                        This campaign was developed for Adobe, focusing on inspiring creativity among students as they
                        design digital
                        campaigns and visual content.

                    <p></p>
                    <p>The goal was to encourage students to explore Adobe tools while creating graphic pieces tailored
                        for digital
                        environments, highlighting originality, experimentation, and self-expression in the creative

                        Tasked with evolving Joe Fresh's typical advertising style, which traditionally features
                        minimalist imagery with a plain background, I explored
                        how to enhance visual storytelling on Instagram through playful design elements like shape,
                        colour, and line, all while maintaining brand coherence.

                    <p>The outcome was providing different assets to be used in the future, which aligns with a social

                    <p>By applying crisis communication knowledge, for the Rogers email banner campaign, I created

                    <p>
                        For the Masonville Place project, I designed a digital banner ad aimed at encouraging online

                    <p></p>
                    <p>The concept focused on creating a vibrant, engaging visual that captures the excitement of

                        offers, seasonal events, and the sensory appeal of shopping locally—to effectively drive foot

                    <p>
                        Naïf art, also known as “naive art,” is a style characterized by its simplicity, vibrant colors,
                        and childlike perspective. It embraces
                        a sense of honesty and emotional clarity, often ignoring traditional artistic rules like
                        proportion and perspective. I incorporate naïf
                        art elements into the city branding to evoke trust, joy, and a deeper human connection with
                        audiences.

                    <p></p>
                    <p>The project background was creating accessible, simple and comprehensive imagery by using
